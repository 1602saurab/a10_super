Install virtual Environment 

pip install virtualenv 

Now we will create our virtual environment 

python -m venv myenv

Now  , we will activate our virtual environment 

myenv\Scripts\activate


What is our goal ? 

Application ---->works as a  chatgpt ----> 
We have to create a function who will take our query as input and send it to LLM(google-generative) and then create response and return the response in textual format . 

So , First of all we have to create a requirements.txt file in which we will have all the
packages or libraries that we need to run this application . 
In 'requirements.txt' file 

streamlit   ----> For ui , we will use this python library  . 
google-generativeai ----> this is our LLM(Large Language Model)
python-dotenv ----> This is used for pass or import our secret credentials from.env file
to another file. 

Now we will create a file (.env) ----> Have all the secrets here . 

API KEey ---> Application Programming Interface who works client to server as a mediator . 

Go to browser ---> Search (Makersuite API Key) ---> Click 'Google Studio' ----> 
Click on 'Create API Key'  ---> paste it into .env file 


Now , we will create a app.py file in which we will have our all logics to create this application . 

For run the application , open the terminal and write 

streamlit run app.py 


When you run your applcation then send this code to github repo . 
WE will create a file (.gitignore) ---> venv , .env 

open the terminal and write  
git init 
git add . 
git status 
git commit -m "added" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/github_user_name/repo_name.git
git push -u origin main
